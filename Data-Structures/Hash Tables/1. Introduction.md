# Introduction

## Notes
> Hash Tables can also be referred to as Maps, Hash Maps, Unordered Maps, Dictionaries, Objects

> In Python they're called dictionaries, JS has objects, Java has Maps, Ruby has Hashes

## What are they?
### Example
> Assume we are at a grocery store and we have a basket for our food items. We want to add 10000 grapes to our basket. <br>
This is similar to the code syntax below for a hash table

 ```
basket.grapes = 10000
 ```
 > grapes is our **__key__**

 > For now, we pass our key into a hash function (don't worry about that right now) and that hash function turns grapes into an index which holds our value 10000
