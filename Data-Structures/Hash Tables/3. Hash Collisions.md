```
let user = {
    age: 54,
    name: 'Bryce',
    magic: true,
    scream: function()
    {
        console.log('ahhhhhh!');
    }
}

user.age //O(1)

user.spell = 'avada kadavra'; // O(1);

## Cons of Hash Tables

Try using the site above and adding 1, 3, 55 (collision), 2, 12, 14 (Another collision)

### What is collision?
- When two inputs hash into the same address / memory space.
- Can slow down accessing/reading your hashtable by O(n/k) where k is the size of your hashtable

### How do you deal with collisions?
- Separate chaining with linkedList (but for the most part we won't have to deal with it.)
