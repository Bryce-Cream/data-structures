# What is a Hash Function?
A function that generates a value of fixed length for each input that it gets.
## What does that mean?
Check out this link for an md5 Hash Generator for a visual example : [Link text Here](http://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php)

In this example, md5 is the type of hash function. (SHA-1, SHA-256)

## Using the md5 Hash Generator
```
//If we pass in 'hello'
//our md5 hash is: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
```
With md5 the string 'hello' will always return that long string of gibberish. But if we change, add, or remove a single letter the entire string changes.<br>
Even capital lets change the md5 hash.
