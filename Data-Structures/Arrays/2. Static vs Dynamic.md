# Static vs Dynamic Arrays
## What's the Difference?
> Static Arrays are fixed in length, you need to specify the length of your array ahead of time.

> Dynamic arrays have adjustable sizes

## Descrepencies in different coding languages
> Some coding languages have fixed arrays and dynamic arrays. In Java you have to declare the size of an array from the start.

> While in JavaScript and python, lists/arrays are mutable from the start.

> In higher level languages you don't have to worry about memory allocation like you would in a different language like C.
